## Article recommender system
With advancements in technology and the proliferation of social media, numerous articles and blog posts are published every day, making it convenient for people to access information from diverse sources. This has led to a surge in the number of individuals seeking to acquire knowledge and broaden their understanding of the world. Companies such as Medium depend on user engagement to generate revenue through their articles and blogs. When a reader discovers an insightful blog, they may be interested in perusing similar documents. If readers are unable to locate comparable articles, they tend to lose interest and disengage. Providing recommendations to users based on the articles they have read can entice them to read more and even subscribe to services that provide valuable and stimulating content.

## Future Scope
There are instances where a reader may lose interest in an article due to the information presented being too complicated or difficult to comprehend. This can cause a drop in interest, particularly when subsequent articles are dissimilar to those previously read. To maintain user engagement, it is important to recommend articles that are similar to those the user has already read. Developing technology that can recommend articles to readers can help to sustain their interest and encourage them to read more articles.
